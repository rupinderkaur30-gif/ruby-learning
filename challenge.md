[x] Define a new class, Kaiju, that
 Is initialized with a Kaiju's name, powers, and latest city destroyed
 Can rewrite the latest city destroyed as it destroys new cities
 Can roar (puts an onomatopoeia of your choice out into the console when #roar is called on it)
 Can stomp (puts out "KAIJU_NAME has stomped a new house" when #stomp is called on it) Bonus:
 Keeps track of the amount of houses that have been stomped and puts "KAIJU_NAME has now stomped NUMBER_OF_HOUSES houses"
Challenge part 2
 Make a #roar_and_stomp method that calls the #roar method and then the #stomp method.
 Make a class method .blue_oyster_cult that puts Oh no, they say he's got to go. then puts Go go Godzilla!
 Make the class Kaiju keep track of all the Kaiju created
 Make a .all method for Kaiju that shows all the Kaiju instances created
 Make a method .total that gives you the number of created Kaiju
Bonus
 Make Kaiju instead initialize with a name, powers, and then an array of all the cities it has destroyed so far, called cities_destroyed
 Make a method called #destroy_city(city) that adds a new city to the kaiju's list of cities_destroyed
 Make a method .houses_destroyed that shows the total count of houses that were stomped on.
 Make a method .cities_destroyed that shows all the cities that have been destroyed so far
Challenge part 3
[] Make houses_stomped an optional argument that defaults to zero in your initialize
[] Make a method called .new_tokyo_destroyer that takes in only a name and a power and initializes a monster that has destroyed Tokyo.
[] Make a .new_with_hash(hash) method that you can call this on to create a new monster:
Kaiju.new_with_hash({name: "Godzooky", power: "Can hang out with teens, tall uncle, glides", cities_destroyed: ["Traverse City"]})
Kaiju.new_with_hash({name: "Mothra", power: "Flight, loogies, heart", cities_destroyed: ["Tokyo", "Nice"], houses_stomped: 4})
Bonus
[] Make a #mecha instance method that creates a copy of the Kaiju it's called on, except with "Mecha-" in front of their name, and that hasn't destroyed any cities. For example, given Godzilla:
godzilla = Kaiju.new("Godzilla", "Atomic Breath", ["Tokyo", "Newark"])
mechagodzilla = godzilla.mecha
# => <Kaiju:0x00007ff034335988 @name="Mecha-Godzilla", @powers="Atomic Breath", @cities_destroyed=[], @houses_stomped=0 >
[] Make a #rebuild(city) instance method that takes in a city name and then removes it from that Kaiju's list of destroyed cities.
[] Make an .enemies(city) method that takes in a city name and returns an array of Kaiju that have destroyed it.
[] Make an .avenge(city) method that takes in a city name and deletes every Kaiju that has destroyed that city.
[] Make a .rebuild(city) class method that takes in a city name and removes it from every Kaiju's list of destroyed cities
